# Factory Cycle Report — 2026-02-26 21:34 (+03)

## Status
- Cycle focus: **Release safety (promote verdict schema validation to CI default)**
- Result: ✅ Completed
- Critical incident: None

## Actions
1. Updated CI workflow `/.github/workflows/deploy.yml` in step **Compute release safety verdict** to enforce schema validation by default:
   - Added env: `RELEASE_VERDICT_VALIDATE_SCHEMA: '1'`
2. Updated `RELEASE-CHECKLIST.md` (Security & Quality) to explicitly require schema-validation enforcement for release verdict in CI.
3. Executed regression check to ensure release verdict logic remains stable:
   - `npm run test:release-verdict` ✅

## Risks
- ✅ Reduced release-risk from silent contract drift by making schema validation mandatory in CI release verdict computation.
- ✅ Better operational clarity by documenting this control in release checklist.
- ⚠️ Residual risk: local/manual runs can still skip schema validation unless env var is set.
- ⚠️ Context risk: memory retrieval tool unavailable (embedding quota exhausted), so task sequencing used repository-local context.

## Next Step
- Add a dedicated CI assertion/test that executes `release:verdict` with `RELEASE_VERDICT_VALIDATE_SCHEMA=1` and fails the pipeline if schema file is missing or invalid.
