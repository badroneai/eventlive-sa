# Factory Cycle Report — 2026-02-26 18:03 (+03)

## Status
- Cycle focus: **Release safety reliability (externalized verdict JSON contract schema)**
- Result: ✅ Completed
- Critical incident: None

## Actions
1. Added dedicated schema artifact: `data/release-verdict.schema.json`.
2. Upgraded `scripts/release-verdict-regression-test.mjs` to load and enforce the schema contract instead of hardcoded contract checks.
3. Kept existing behavior assertions (`expectedVerdict`, `expectedReason`) to preserve policy-level correctness alongside contract compliance.
4. Executed regression verification:
   - `npm run test:release-verdict` ✅
   - `npm run test:validation` ✅
   - `npm run test:csv` ✅

## Risks
- ✅ Reduced drift risk by centralizing release verdict output contract in a reusable schema file.
- ✅ Improved maintainability: future contract changes can be managed in one place and validated in tests.
- ⚠️ Residual risk: runtime script does not yet self-validate output against schema (enforced in regression layer only).
- ⚠️ Context risk: memory retrieval service was unavailable (embedding quota exhausted), so this cycle relied on repository-local history only.

## Next Step
- Add optional runtime schema validation mode in `scripts/release-safety-verdict.mjs` (or CI gate) to fail fast if output diverges from `data/release-verdict.schema.json` before downstream consumption.
