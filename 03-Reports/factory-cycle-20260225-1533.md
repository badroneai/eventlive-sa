# Factory Cycle Report — 2026-02-25 15:33 (+03)

## Status
- Cycle focus: **Release safety reliability (lock verdict policy with regression tests)**
- Result: ✅ Completed
- Critical incident: None

## Actions
1. Created dedicated regression test suite for release verdict policy:
   - Added `scripts/release-verdict-regression-test.mjs`.
   - Covers core scenarios:
     - PASS when all active checks pass.
     - HOLD when uptime/stability fails.
     - HOLD when active SLO gate fails.
     - ATTENTION when SLO is in warm-up (`INACTIVE`).
     - ATTENTION when SLO state is unavailable (`n/a`).
2. Extended npm scripts in `package.json`:
   - Added `test:release-verdict`.
3. Integrated the new test into CI build flow in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:
   - Added step `Run release verdict regression tests` immediately after existing regression checks.
4. Executed local verification:
   - `npm run test:validation` ✅
   - `npm run test:csv` ✅
   - `npm run test:release-verdict` ✅

## Risks
- ✅ Reduced regression risk for release go/no-go policy logic.
- ✅ Better release safety confidence because verdict behavior is now covered by explicit scenario tests.
- ⚠️ Residual risk: test assertions depend on exact output text; future wording changes require synchronized test updates.

## Next Step
- Emit machine-readable JSON output mode for `release-safety-verdict.mjs` (in addition to console text) so tests can assert structured fields and become less brittle to message wording changes.
