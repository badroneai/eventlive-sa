# Factory Cycle Report — 2026-02-27 18:33 (+03)

## Status
- Cycle focus: **Release safety reliability (CI gate execution consistency)**
- Result: ✅ Completed
- Critical incident: None

## Actions
1. Added a single aggregate schema-gate command in npm scripts:
   - `test:release-verdict-schema-suite`
   - Includes full sequence:
     - positive schema gate
     - invalid enum negative gate
     - missing required field negative gate
     - additional property negative gate
     - nested type mismatch negative gate
2. Simplified CI workflow execution path in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:
   - Replaced multiple separate schema gate steps with one canonical step:
     - **Run release verdict schema suite (positive + fail-closed negatives)**
     - `npm run test:release-verdict-schema-suite`
3. Performed local verification of unified command:
   - `npm run test:release-verdict-schema-suite` ✅

## Risks
- ✅ Reduced CI drift risk (single source of truth for schema gate order and scope).
- ✅ Lowered maintenance overhead when adding/removing schema checks in future cycles.
- ⚠️ Residual risk: a single suite step gives less granular per-check step labeling in GitHub Actions UI (failure details remain visible in logs).

## Next Step
- Add a compact per-check marker summary output (start/end tokens per sub-check) within the suite path to preserve fast triage visibility while keeping single-step CI wiring.
