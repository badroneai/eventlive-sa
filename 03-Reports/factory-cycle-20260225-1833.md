# Factory Cycle Report — 2026-02-25 18:33 (+03)

## Status
- Cycle focus: **Release safety reliability (make verdict tests resilient via structured output)**
- Result: ✅ Completed
- Critical incident: None

## Actions
1. Enhanced `scripts/release-safety-verdict.mjs` with output mode support:
   - Added `RELEASE_VERDICT_OUTPUT_MODE` env control.
   - `text` mode (default): preserves existing human-readable line.
   - `json` mode: emits structured payload with:
     - `verdict`
     - `reason`
     - `inputs` (uptime/stability/SLO outcomes + enforcement state)
2. Upgraded `scripts/release-verdict-regression-test.mjs` to use JSON mode:
   - Runs script with `RELEASE_VERDICT_OUTPUT_MODE=json`.
   - Parses JSON and asserts `verdict` + `reason` fields directly.
   - Removes brittleness tied to exact log-string formatting.
3. Executed verification checks:
   - `npm run test:release-verdict` ✅
   - `npm run test:validation` ✅
   - `npm run test:csv` ✅

## Risks
- ✅ Lower false-negative risk in policy tests caused by cosmetic text changes.
- ✅ Better diagnosability through structured `inputs` in JSON output.
- ⚠️ Residual risk: current CI scorecard still uses GitHub outputs (not JSON stream), so dual mode must remain backward-compatible.

## Next Step
- Add a lightweight schema/assertion check for the JSON contract (required keys + enum validation) to prevent accidental output-shape drift.
