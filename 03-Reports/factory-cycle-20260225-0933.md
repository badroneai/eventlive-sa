# Factory Cycle Report — 2026-02-25 09:33 (+03)

## Status
- Cycle focus: **Release safety UX (single go/no-go verdict in release scorecard)**
- Result: ✅ Completed
- Critical incident: None

## Actions
1. Updated `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` in `verify-release` → `Create release scorecard summary` step.
2. Added runtime verdict logic using check outcomes and SLO enforcement state:
   - `PASS`: all active release checks pass.
   - `ATTENTION`: SLO enforcement is inactive (warm-up) or state unavailable.
   - `HOLD`: uptime/stability fails, or active SLO policy fails.
3. Published a new scorecard line:
   - `Release safety verdict: <PASS|ATTENTION|HOLD> (<reason>)`
4. Preserved current hard-fail gate behavior in the workflow (no change to blocking logic).
5. Ran quick regression checks after update:
   - `npm run test:validation` ✅
   - `npm run test:csv` ✅

## Risks
- ✅ Faster operator decision-making in deployments with one explicit verdict line.
- ✅ Reduced misinterpretation risk when SLO is still in warm-up mode.
- ⚠️ Verdict logic now lives in workflow shell; future policy expansions should be mirrored carefully to avoid drift.

## Next Step
- Move verdict computation into a dedicated script (e.g., `scripts/release-safety-verdict.mjs`) and emit structured outputs to reduce workflow complexity and improve testability.
