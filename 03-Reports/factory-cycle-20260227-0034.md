# Factory Cycle Report — 2026-02-27 00:34 (+03)

## Status
- Cycle focus: **Release safety reliability (dedicated CI assertion for verdict schema enforcement)**
- Result: ✅ Completed
- Critical incident: None

## Actions
1. Added a dedicated CI assertion script:
   - `scripts/release-verdict-schema-ci-check.mjs`
   - Executes `release-safety-verdict.mjs` with:
     - `RELEASE_VERDICT_VALIDATE_SCHEMA=1`
     - `RELEASE_VERDICT_OUTPUT_MODE=json`
     - deterministic healthy inputs
   - Fails if process exits non-zero, output is invalid JSON, or required top-level fields are missing.
2. Added npm script entry:
   - `test:release-verdict-schema-ci`
3. Integrated new gate into CI workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`):
   - New build step: **Run release verdict schema CI gate test**
4. Verification executed locally:
   - `npm run test:release-verdict` ✅
   - `npm run test:release-verdict-schema-ci` ✅
   - `npm run test:validation` ✅
   - `npm run test:csv` ✅

## Risks
- ✅ Reduced risk of hidden schema regressions by adding a dedicated CI check for enforceability.
- ✅ Improves release safety continuity by testing the same runtime path used by release verdict computation.
- ⚠️ Residual risk: check validates enforceability under healthy fixture inputs; does not yet include negative-path mutation tests in CI.
- ⚠️ Context risk: memory retrieval service unavailable (embedding quota exhausted), sequencing was based on repo-local reports.

## Next Step
- Extend CI gate with a controlled negative-path test (temporary invalid schema/fixture) to prove fail-closed behavior and keep false-pass probability low.
