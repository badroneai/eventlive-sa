# Factory Cycle Report — 2026-02-28 12:33 (+03)

## Status
- Cycle focus: **Release safety reliability (cross-run persistence for schema runtime trending)**
- Result: ✅ Completed
- Critical incident: None

## Actions
1. Added CI cache restore/save for schema runtime trend history in build workflow:
   - Updated `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.
   - Added `actions/cache/restore@v4` before regression evaluation:
     - path: `ops/schema-suite-runtime-history.json`
     - key prefix by branch: `schema-suite-history-${{ github.ref_name }}-`
   - Added `actions/cache/save@v4` after regression evaluation (`if: always()`) to persist latest trend history across pipeline runs.
2. Expanded CI evidence artifact coverage:
   - Included `reports/*.json` and `ops/schema-suite-runtime-history.json` in uploaded CI evidence bundle.
3. Local verification:
   - `npm run test:release-verdict-schema-suite` ✅
   - `npm run test:release-verdict-schema-regression` ✅
   - Current state moved forward in warm-up progression (`baseline_samples=3/5`).

## Risks
- ✅ Addresses prior gap where runtime history was local-only and lost between CI runs.
- ✅ Improves signal continuity for regression detection and release safety decisions.
- ⚠️ Cache can be unavailable on first run or occasionally evicted; warm-up behavior still required as fallback.

## Next Step
- Add a workflow summary line for schema regression status (`OK/WARN/WARMUP` + samples progress) so release reviewers can assess trend health directly from the GitHub run summary.
