# Factory Cycle Report — 2026-02-28 15:33 (+03)

## Status
- Cycle focus: **Release safety UX (GitHub run visibility for schema regression trend)**
- Result: ✅ Completed
- Critical incident: None

## Actions
1. Added dedicated schema regression summary publisher script:
   - New file: `scripts/schema-suite-regression-summary.mjs`
   - Reads `reports/schema-suite-regression-status.json`
   - Emits concise trend line to logs
   - Writes to `GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` when available (status, latest duration, baseline, threshold, sample progress, consecutive count)
   - Exposes outputs through `GITHUB_OUTPUT` for optional downstream use.
2. Added npm command:
   - `report:release-verdict-schema-regression` in `package.json`.
3. Integrated summary publishing into CI build workflow:
   - Updated `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
   - Added step `Publish schema runtime regression summary` directly after regression evaluation so release reviewers get immediate run-level visibility.
4. Local verification:
   - `npm run test:release-verdict-schema-suite` ✅
   - `npm run test:release-verdict-schema-regression` ✅
   - `npm run report:release-verdict-schema-regression` ✅
   - Current trend state: `WARMUP` with sample progress `4/5`.

## Risks
- ✅ Improves operator UX by surfacing trend health in run summary without opening artifacts manually.
- ✅ Low implementation risk (read-only reporter over existing status JSON).
- ⚠️ If status JSON generation fails upstream, summary step will fail; this is acceptable as it highlights missing release-safety evidence.

## Next Step
- Add branch policy thresholds (e.g., stricter regression factor on `master`, lenient on feature branches) and display policy mode in the same summary block.
