# Factory Cycle Report — 2026-02-27 21:33 (+03)

## Status
- Cycle focus: **Release safety reliability (faster CI triage visibility)**
- Result: ✅ Completed
- Critical incident: None

## Actions
1. Implemented a dedicated schema suite runner with explicit check markers:
   - Added `scripts/release-verdict-schema-suite.mjs`
   - Runs all schema gates in canonical order (positive + fail-closed negatives)
   - Emits deterministic markers for log parsing and human triage:
     - `SCHEMA_SUITE_CHECK_START <name>`
     - `SCHEMA_SUITE_CHECK_END <name> status=<PASS|FAIL>`
     - `SCHEMA_SUITE_SUMMARY_START/END`
     - `SCHEMA_SUITE_RESULT <name> <status>`
2. Preserved fail-fast behavior:
   - Suite stops at first failing check
   - Emits `SCHEMA_SUITE_FAIL` marker on failure paths
3. Updated npm script wiring:
   - `test:release-verdict-schema-suite` now points to `node scripts/release-verdict-schema-suite.mjs`
4. Verified locally:
   - `npm run test:release-verdict-schema-suite` ✅
   - All five schema checks passed with summary markers present.

## Risks
- ✅ Improves release safety observability in CI logs while keeping single-step pipeline wiring.
- ✅ Reduces diagnosis time during gate failures (clear start/end + compact summary block).
- ⚠️ Residual risk: suite currently serial; runtime will increase linearly as more checks are added.

## Next Step
- Add optional lightweight duration metrics per check in suite output (`duration_ms`) to identify slow/failing patterns early without increasing CI complexity.
