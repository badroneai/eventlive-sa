# Factory Cycle Report — 2026-03-01 06:34 (+03)

## Status
- Cycle focus: **Release safety (override governance hardening for schema regression gate)**
- Result: ✅ Completed
- Critical incident: None

## Actions
1. Implemented explicit override governance in `RELEASE-CHECKLIST.md` for `SCHEMA_REGRESSION_OVERRIDE`.
2. Added mandatory constraints for emergency use:
   - Allowed only for production-blocking emergency on protected branch.
   - Authorized actors limited to Release Manager / Incident Commander.
3. Added traceability requirements:
   - Must link ticket/incident before activation.
   - Must create/update incident record in `04-Incidents/` with reason, risk scope, rollback/fix plan, and override removal time.
4. Added operational closure requirements:
   - Override must be removed in the same change window.
   - Root-cause follow-up + clean suite rerun required within 24h.

## Risks
- ✅ Reduces risk of silent/unaudited override usage that bypasses protected-branch safeguards.
- ✅ Improves auditability and release accountability during emergency deployments.
- ⚠️ Process remains dependent on human discipline (checklist adherence and incident documentation quality).

## Next Step
- Add CI evidence step in `deploy.yml` to fail release when override is enabled without a linked incident ID (e.g., required `SCHEMA_REGRESSION_OVERRIDE_INCIDENT` variable matching `INC-###`).
