# Factory Cycle Report — 2026-02-28 03:33 (+03)

## Status
- Cycle focus: **Release safety reliability (timing persistence for schema suite)**
- Result: ✅ Completed
- Critical incident: None

## Actions
1. Extended schema suite runner to persist timing output into a report artifact:
   - Updated `scripts/release-verdict-schema-suite.mjs`
   - Added markdown report write to `reports/schema-suite-timing.md` on every run (pass/fail).
2. Report now includes:
   - generation timestamp (`generated_at`)
   - suite status (`PASS`/`FAIL`)
   - total suite duration (`total_duration_ms`)
   - per-check status and `duration_ms`
3. Preserved current behavior:
   - fail-fast on first failing check
   - machine-readable console markers remain unchanged (`SCHEMA_SUITE_CHECK_*`, `SCHEMA_SUITE_RESULT`, total duration marker).
4. Local verification:
   - `npm run test:release-verdict-schema-suite` ✅
   - Generated artifact confirmed at `reports/schema-suite-timing.md`.
   - Observed local baseline total runtime: **603 ms**.

## Risks
- ✅ Better release-safety observability with persistent timing evidence available for CI artifacts and audits.
- ✅ No impact on gate strictness; schema fail-closed guarantees remain enforced.
- ⚠️ Residual risk: timestamped report content changes every run and can create repo noise if committed frequently.

## Next Step
- Keep `reports/schema-suite-timing.md` as CI evidence artifact and avoid routine repo commits for it; add threshold-based alerting only when runtime regression persists across consecutive runs.
