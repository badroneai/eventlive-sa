# Factory Cycle Report — 2026-02-28 21:33 (+03)

## Status
- Cycle focus: **Release safety UX (scorecard visibility for schema regression policy state)**
- Result: ✅ Completed
- Critical incident: None

## Actions
1. Updated CI status summary in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` to expose schema regression trend outputs directly in the build scorecard:
   - `schema_regression_status`
   - `schema_regression_policy_mode` + `schema_regression_branch_name`
   - `schema_regression_samples_progress`
   - `schema_regression_consecutive`
2. Reused existing step outputs from `schema_regression_summary` (no duplicate logic), ensuring one source of truth for release-safety trend telemetry.
3. Local verification (protected branch simulation):
   - `npm run test:release-verdict-schema-suite` ✅
   - `npm run test:release-verdict-schema-regression` ✅
   - `npm run report:release-verdict-schema-regression` ✅
   - Current observed state: `OK`, policy `STRICT_PROTECTED`, samples `6/5`, consecutive `0/2`.

## Risks
- ✅ Improves reviewer UX and decision speed by surfacing regression policy posture in the main run summary.
- ✅ Low operational risk; change is additive to summary output only.
- ⚠️ If summary-output contract changes in reporter script, workflow summary lines may show `n/a` until adjusted.

## Next Step
- Mirror the same schema regression lines into the `verify-release` job scorecard (or pass outputs via artifacts) so post-deploy release verdict and pre-deploy schema trend appear together in one final decision block.
