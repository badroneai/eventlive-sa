# Factory Cycle Report — 2026-03-01 09:34 (+03)

## Status
- Cycle focus: **Release safety (override-evidence enforcement in CI)**
- Result: ✅ Completed
- Critical incident: None

## Actions
1. Hardened protected-branch schema regression gate in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.
2. Added required CI evidence variable when override is active:
   - `SCHEMA_REGRESSION_OVERRIDE_INCIDENT` (expected format: `INC-###...`).
3. Enforced fail-closed behavior for invalid override evidence:
   - If policy=`STRICT_PROTECTED`, status=`WARN`, override=`1`, and incident ID missing/invalid → gate blocks with `decision=BLOCK_INVALID_OVERRIDE_EVIDENCE`.
4. Preserved emergency path with accountability:
   - Override still allowed only when incident ID is valid, yielding `decision=OVERRIDDEN`.
5. Extended release scorecard summary with explicit incident evidence visibility:
   - Added line: `Schema regression override incident`.
6. Updated `RELEASE-CHECKLIST.md` governance section to require setting
   `SCHEMA_REGRESSION_OVERRIDE_INCIDENT=INC-###` when override is used.

## Risks
- ✅ Closes audit gap where override could be used without traceable incident linkage.
- ✅ Increases release safety by making emergency bypasses attributable and reviewable.
- ⚠️ Depends on correct repository variable entry; malformed IDs now intentionally block release verification.

## Next Step
- Add a lightweight CI preflight check that validates incident file existence (matching the provided `INC-###`) under `04-Incidents/` and includes it in release artifacts for direct auditor traceability.
