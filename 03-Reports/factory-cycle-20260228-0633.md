# Factory Cycle Report — 2026-02-28 06:33 (+03)

## Status
- Cycle focus: **Release safety (schema suite runtime regression detection)**
- Result: ✅ Completed
- Critical incident: None

## Actions
1. Implemented consecutive-run runtime regression checker for schema suite:
   - Added `scripts/schema-suite-regression-check.mjs`.
   - Reads latest `reports/schema-suite-timing.md` and tracks trend using:
     - regression factor (default `1.5x` baseline)
     - consecutive-run threshold (default `3`)
   - Writes machine-readable + human-readable outputs:
     - `reports/schema-suite-regression-status.json`
     - `reports/schema-suite-regression-status.md`
   - Supports optional hard-fail mode via `SCHEMA_SUITE_REGRESSION_FAIL_ON_DETECTED=1`.
2. Added npm script:
   - `test:release-verdict-schema-regression` in `package.json`.
3. Integrated into CI release pipeline:
   - Updated `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` to run regression trend evaluation right after schema suite execution.
4. Local verification completed:
   - `npm run test:release-verdict-schema-suite` ✅
   - `npm run test:release-verdict-schema-regression` ✅
   - Current run status: `OK` (no persistent regression detected).

## Risks
- ✅ Improves release-safety observability by surfacing sustained performance regressions instead of one-off spikes.
- ✅ Default mode is non-blocking, reducing false-positive deployment interruptions.
- ⚠️ Residual risk: baseline comes from earliest PASS sample in local history; if baseline quality is poor, threshold may need recalibration.

## Next Step
- Calibrate regression policy using real CI history (e.g., p95-based baseline or rolling median) and decide when to switch from warning mode to blocking mode in protected branches.
