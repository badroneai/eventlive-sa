# Factory Cycle Report — 2026-02-25 06:33 (+03)

## Status
- Cycle focus: **Release safety + operator UX (explicit SLO enforcement hint in release scorecard)**
- Result: ✅ Completed
- Critical incident: None

## Actions
1. Implemented a compact SLO enforcement signal in `scripts/check-reliability-slo.mjs`:
   - Added `enforcement_state` output (`ACTIVE` / `INACTIVE`) alongside existing gate outputs.
   - Set fail-safe behavior for malformed/missing rollup paths to report `enforcement_state=ACTIVE` with `policy_state=FAIL`.
2. Updated release summary in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:
   - Added `SLO enforcement mode` line from script output.
   - Added policy hint line:
     - `blocking gate active` when enforcement is active.
     - `warm-up mode (non-blocking until sample minimum)` when inactive.
3. Ran local verification suite:
   - `npm run test:validation` ✅
   - `npm run test:csv` ✅
   - `npm run pipeline` ✅
   - `npm run reliability:rollup` ✅
   - `npm run reliability:slo-gate` ✅ (`SLO_GATE_SKIPPED insufficient_samples=2 min_required=8`)

## Risks
- ✅ Reduced interpretation ambiguity in CI release scorecard for go/no-go decisions.
- ✅ Better handoff clarity for non-author reviewers through direct policy hint text.
- ⚠️ Residual risk remains: enforcement is correctly non-blocking until the sample threshold is reached.

## Next Step
- Add a single “release safety verdict” line that combines uptime, stability, and SLO enforcement state into one operator-facing decision signal (PASS / ATTENTION / HOLD).
