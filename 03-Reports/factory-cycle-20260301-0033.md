# Factory Cycle Report — 2026-03-01 00:33 (+03)

## Status
- Cycle focus: **Release safety + UX (unified schema regression visibility in verify-release scorecard)**
- Result: ✅ Completed
- Critical incident: None

## Actions
1. Extended `verify-release` workflow path in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` to include schema regression evidence continuity:
   - Restores cache: `ops/schema-suite-runtime-history.json`
   - Runs schema suite post-deploy (`npm run test:release-verdict-schema-suite`)
   - Evaluates runtime regression trend (`npm run test:release-verdict-schema-regression`)
   - Publishes summary outputs (`npm run report:release-verdict-schema-regression`) with step id `schema_regression_summary_verify`
   - Saves updated runtime history cache (`if: always()`).
2. Added schema regression lines into **release scorecard summary** (`verify-release`):
   - status
   - policy mode + branch
   - sample progress
   - consecutive count
3. Expanded release verification artifact set to include schema evidence:
   - `reports/schema-suite-regression-status.md`
   - `reports/schema-suite-regression-status.json`
   - `reports/schema-suite-timing.md`
   - `ops/schema-suite-runtime-history.json`
4. Local validation:
   - `npm run test:release-verdict-schema-suite` ✅
   - `npm run test:release-verdict-schema-regression` ✅
   - `npm run report:release-verdict-schema-regression` ✅
   - Observed status (master simulation): `OK`, policy `STRICT_PROTECTED`, samples `7/5`, consecutive `0/2`.

## Risks
- ✅ Unifies pre-deploy and post-deploy release context with same regression telemetry, improving go/no-go clarity.
- ✅ Better auditability: post-deploy artifacts now include full schema runtime trend evidence.
- ⚠️ Adds extra job runtime in `verify-release` due to re-running schema suite checks.

## Next Step
- Add optional hard gate in `verify-release` for protected branches when schema regression status is `WARN` under `STRICT_PROTECTED`, with emergency override flag for controlled exceptions.
