# Factory Cycle Report — 2026-02-27 03:34 (+03)

## Status
- Cycle focus: **Release safety reliability (fail-closed negative-path CI validation)**
- Result: ✅ Completed
- Critical incident: None

## Actions
1. Added negative-path CI guard script:
   - `scripts/release-verdict-schema-negative-ci-check.mjs`
   - Runs `release-safety-verdict.mjs` with schema validation enabled and intentionally invalid enum input:
     - `SLO_ENFORCEMENT_STATE=BROKEN_STATE`
   - Asserts fail-closed behavior:
     - non-zero exit required
     - strict expected exit code `2`
     - stderr/stdout must include `RELEASE_VERDICT_SCHEMA_FAIL`
2. Added npm task:
   - `test:release-verdict-schema-negative-ci`
3. Integrated into build workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`):
   - New step: **Run release verdict schema negative-path gate test**
4. Ran local verification:
   - `npm run test:release-verdict` ✅
   - `npm run test:release-verdict-schema-ci` ✅
   - `npm run test:release-verdict-schema-negative-ci` ✅
   - `npm run test:validation` ✅
   - `npm run test:csv` ✅

## Risks
- ✅ Reduced false-pass risk by explicitly proving schema enforcement fails closed under invalid input.
- ✅ Increased release gate confidence with both positive and negative CI assertions.
- ⚠️ Residual risk: tests focus on enum failure path; other schema mismatch classes (e.g., missing keys) are still covered indirectly, not via dedicated negative CI fixtures.
- ⚠️ Context risk: memory retrieval unavailable (embedding quota exhausted); cycle continuity used repository-local reports.

## Next Step
- Add a second negative-path CI test for missing required field simulation (contract completeness) to broaden fail-closed coverage beyond enum violations.
