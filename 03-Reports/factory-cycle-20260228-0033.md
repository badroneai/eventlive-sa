# Factory Cycle Report — 2026-02-28 00:33 (+03)

## Status
- Cycle focus: **Release safety reliability (schema-suite runtime observability)**
- Result: ✅ Completed
- Critical incident: None

## Actions
1. Enhanced schema suite runner with per-check timing telemetry:
   - Updated `scripts/release-verdict-schema-suite.mjs`
   - Added `duration_ms` measurement for every sub-check.
   - Extended end markers:
     - `SCHEMA_SUITE_CHECK_END <name> status=<...> duration_ms=<...>`
2. Added total suite duration output:
   - New summary marker: `SCHEMA_SUITE_TOTAL_DURATION_MS <value>`
3. Extended summary lines with timings:
   - `SCHEMA_SUITE_RESULT <name> <status> duration_ms=<...>`
4. Verified locally:
   - `npm run test:release-verdict-schema-suite` ✅
   - All checks passed.
   - Observed baseline total runtime: **933 ms** in local run.

## Risks
- ✅ Improves CI diagnosis by making slow/failing checks immediately visible without extra tools.
- ✅ Preserves existing fail-fast and fail-closed behavior.
- ⚠️ Residual risk: single local runtime sample is informational only; GitHub runner variance may differ by load and environment.

## Next Step
- Persist suite timing snapshots to a lightweight report artifact (e.g., `reports/schema-suite-timing.md`) and alert only when a check exceeds a practical threshold for two consecutive runs.
