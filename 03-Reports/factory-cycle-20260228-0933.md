# Factory Cycle Report — 2026-02-28 09:33 (+03)

## Status
- Cycle focus: **Release safety reliability (baseline quality for schema runtime regression detection)**
- Result: ✅ Completed
- Critical incident: None

## Actions
1. Upgraded schema runtime regression logic to reduce false baseline bias:
   - Updated `scripts/schema-suite-regression-check.mjs`.
   - Replaced single fixed baseline behavior with **rolling median baseline** from recent PASS samples.
2. Added warm-up semantics for safer signal quality:
   - New config: `SCHEMA_SUITE_BASELINE_WINDOW` (default: 10)
   - New config: `SCHEMA_SUITE_BASELINE_MIN_SAMPLES` (default: 5)
   - Status now returns `WARMUP` until minimum PASS samples are collected.
3. Added richer status telemetry in output reports:
   - `baseline_source=rolling_median`
   - `baseline_ready`, `baseline_sample_count`, `baseline_window`, `baseline_min_samples`
4. Local verification:
   - `npm run test:release-verdict-schema-suite` ✅
   - `npm run test:release-verdict-schema-regression` ✅
   - Current regression state: `WARMUP` (2/5 baseline samples collected).

## Risks
- ✅ Better resilience to noisy first-run timings; threshold now based on trend-oriented baseline.
- ✅ Safer detection posture: avoids overreacting before enough data exists.
- ⚠️ During `WARMUP`, persistent regressions may not be fully classified until sample minimum is reached.

## Next Step
- Promote baseline readiness faster in CI by retaining runtime history artifact across runs (or seeding baseline from last successful pipeline), then evaluate enabling blocking mode (`SCHEMA_SUITE_REGRESSION_FAIL_ON_DETECTED=1`) on protected branches.
