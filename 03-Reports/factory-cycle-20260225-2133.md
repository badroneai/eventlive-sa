# Factory Cycle Report — 2026-02-25 21:33 (+03)

## Status
- Cycle focus: **Release safety reliability (JSON contract guardrails for verdict output)**
- Result: ✅ Completed
- Critical incident: None

## Actions
1. Strengthened `scripts/release-verdict-regression-test.mjs` with explicit JSON contract checks for `release-safety-verdict` output.
2. Added schema-like assertions per test case:
   - `verdict` must be one of: `PASS`, `ATTENTION`, `HOLD`.
   - `reason` must be a non-empty string.
   - `inputs` object must exist.
   - Required `inputs` keys must be present:
     - `uptimeOutcome`
     - `stabilityOutcome`
     - `sloOutcome`
     - `sloEnforcementState`
   - `inputs.sloEnforcementState` must be one of: `ACTIVE`, `INACTIVE`, `N/A`.
3. Retained existing scenario correctness assertions (`verdict` + `reason`) to ensure both contract integrity and policy behavior.
4. Ran local verification:
   - `npm run test:release-verdict` ✅
   - `npm run test:validation` ✅
   - `npm run test:csv` ✅

## Risks
- ✅ Reduced output-shape drift risk for release verdict JSON mode.
- ✅ Improved early detection if future refactors break CI-consumed structured fields.
- ⚠️ Residual risk: contract checks are in test code (not a reusable JSON schema artifact), so external consumers still rely on repo discipline.

## Next Step
- Extract the verdict output contract into a dedicated schema file (e.g., `data/release_verdict.schema.json`) and validate against it in tests for cleaner governance and reuse.
